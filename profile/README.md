# Java For Retards
Basically me trying to teach [Pooblic](https://github.com/pooblic) users programming. Below you'll find a bunch of links pertinent to the course.

## Summaries
1. [Introduction to Programming](summaries/1-introduction.md)
2. [Java Fundamentals](summaries/2-java-fundamentals.md)
3. [Methods and Classes](summaries/3-methods-and-classes.md)

## Homework (and solutions)
1. [Hello World!](https://github.com/JavaForRetards/lesson1-homework)
2. [Array sorting](https://github.com/JavaForRetards/lesson2-homework)

## Useful downloads
Must-haves are:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which we'll use as VCS (version-control system).
    - When prompted about what editor to use, please choose Notepad++ or anything you are already familiar with if you're not already a vim expert, don't leave the default. I seriously can't be bothered to assist you with that.
    - I'll assume you're using CLI Git in the course, but if you wanna be a cringe skid there is a shitton of simplified wrappers - for instance, the [GitHub application](https://cli.github.com/) and its [GUI version](https://desktop.github.com/). Just know that you'll have to figure it out on your own if you have problems using these.
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html), which is my IDE of choice for Java. That's the FOSS (free and open source) version, but if you're a university student you might even be [apply](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/) to get the Ultimate Edition for free. For the purposes of our lessons, you won't really need the extra features, so it's really up to you.
- [JDK](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/), specifically version 8. Any JDK implementation work, the one I linked is the FOSS one.

### Optional for Windows users
If you're using Windows 10 or higher, I can't recommend enough using these two over Git bash or, worse, the normal cmd:
- [PowerShell 7](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/powershell/9MZ1SNWT0N5D), which is a net upgrade over the ancient version bundled with your system.
- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), which is a neat UI for any command-line based program that supports themes, multiple tabs and more.

PowerShell 7 specifically *might* work on older Windows version, but I'm not sure. Get it [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/).
